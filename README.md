# Dealer Studio - Technical Test
_by Marco Buontempo_

## Mockup Target
![Mockup](./test-mockup.jpg)

### Tasks
1. DONE Build the Project using React ( or Next JS )
2. DONE Use SCSS/TailwindCSS (preferably) or plain CSS for the styling
3. DONE Use of components, e.g, the card should be made with components such as Card, CardImage, CardHeader, CardBody, Button. Please do not use ANY component libraries or packages like MUI or ANT design. We want to see you are able to build these components yourself.
4. DONE It should be responsive, and look good on desktop and mobile, the cards should be in a single column on mobile.
5. DONE Card 3 needs to have 2 paragraphs of text in it so it's higher than the other cards
6. DONE We are looking for attention to detail, padding, border radius, box shadow, overlays, alignment as per the design.
7. DONE We want to see some sort of state management being used, we would suggest on the border. On load, the middle card should have a border, when you click a cards button, the border should switch to that card that was clicked, but always be on the middle card on load.
8. DONE Push code to your Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket account so we can view the code

### Optionals
- DONE Fetch card data from a mock API (you can use a local /data/cards.json)
- DONE Display a loading state while fetching
- DONE Display a user-friendly error if the fetch fails
- DONE Animate the border switch with a smooth transition
- DONE Add an image hover overlay (e.g., show CTA text when hovering over the image)
- DONE Add a light/dark mode toggle using global state
- DONE Write 1â€“2 unit tests with Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library for the border logic
